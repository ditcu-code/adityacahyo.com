Kelolaternak is a cross‑platform livestock management app, part of the Bantuternak ecosystem. I built core experiences from data modeling to UI, enabling farms to track cattle records in real time with rich media and fast filtering across large datasets.

#### Highlights
- React Native + Expo app targeting mobile and web
- Real‑time cattle tracking with multi‑angle photos and geolocation for 1000+ records
- Advanced filtering, search, and analytics for farm operations
- Secure authentication and role‑based access for 5 user types (org and farm level)
- Responsive, adaptive UI built with Tamagui + TypeScript

#### Key Improvements
- Migrated database from Firebase → Supabase, simplifying queries and removing complex indexing
- Integrated ImageKit for photo storage with instant thumbnails and dynamic resizing, improving performance and flexibility over Supabase Storage
